        "\n",
        "The entire process can be executed in a single step within Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Google Colab environment\n",
        "- Pandas Python Library\n",
        "- Openpyxl Python Library\n",
        "- python-docx Library\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're running this in Google Colab, the above dependencies can be installed using `!pip install` commands.\n",

        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- Upload multiple Excel files directly from your computer to the Google Colab environment.\n",
        "- Search for multiple keywords across all uploaded Excel sheets.\n",
        "- Generate a report that contains the locations (worksheet, row, and column) where these keywords are found.\n",
        "- Export the generated report as a Microsoft Word document.\n",

        "### Single-Click Execution\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool is designed for ease-of-use and can be executed in a single click within Google Colab. Just click the \"Run\" button to execute the entire script. If a warning message about the notebook's author appears, simply click \"Run Anyway\" to proceed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What Happens When You Run the Script:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Dependencies**: The necessary Python libraries will be installed automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **File Upload**: A file upload dialog will appear. Here, you can upload one or multiple Excel files that you want to scan for keywords.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Input Keywords**: After uploading the files, you will be prompted to enter the keywords you want to search for, separated by commas. Input them and hit \"Enter.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run Keyword Search and Generate Report**: The script will automatically scan the uploaded files for the specified keywords and compile a report.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Download Report**: A Word document containing the located keywords and their positions will be generated. You will be prompted to download this file to your local machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "By clicking \"Run\" just once, you execute all these steps in a single go, making the process seamless and efficient.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The tool currently supports Excel files; other file formats are not supported.\n",
        "- It is essential to ensure that the Excel files do not have password protection, as this will cause the upload to fail.\n",

        "# Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "## Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Inspection\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scenario: Verifying Compliance and Data Integrity in LC-MS/MS Acquisition Data\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Context:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You are a Data Analyst responsible for ensuring that the data generated from Liquid Chromatographyâ€“Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) adheres to the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).\n",
        "- You have exported large datasets from acquisition software used in LC-MS/MS.\n",
        "- You need to review multiple Excel files to verify if any manual integration took place and to check the quality control results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How This Tool Can Help:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automating the Compliance Check**: Manually going through hundreds or thousands of rows to find instances of manual integration or QC checks that have not passed can be time-consuming and error-prone. This tool can automate that process, significantly reducing the time and effort required.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Keyword Search for Manual Integration**: By entering specific keywords associated with manual integration, you can quickly identify any rows or cells where manual overrides or adjustments have been made.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Quality Control (QC) Checks**: You can also input keywords or codes related to QC checks to find instances where QC or Calibration Controls (CC) have not passed, which is crucial for ensuring the data's integrity and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Report Generation for Audits**: The tool generates a Word document that can serve as a formal record for compliance checks, especially helpful during internal or external GCP inspections.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Multi-File Compatibility**: Often, LC-MS/MS acquisition data might be spread across multiple files, and this tool can search through all of them in one go.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Execute:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Upload the exported Excel files from the LC-MS/MS acquisition software into the Google Colab environment.\n",
        "2. Enter keywords related to manual integration (e.g., \"manual\", \"override\") and QC/CC checks that did not pass (e.g., \"QC Fail\", \"CC Not Passed\").\n",
        "3. Run the script. Within moments, you'll have a report indicating where, if at all, the data may have issues concerning GCP compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using this tool in a GCP inspection context, you can greatly enhance your efficiency and accuracy in ensuring data integrity and compliance."
